# About Me
I went to the East Coast (specifically, New York, New Jersey, and DC) during the first week of August.
Where did you find the most interesting?
Empire State Building and Top of the Rock were the most interesting in New York, as well as the International Spy Museum in DC, were the most interesting. I also got to reunite with my uncle and one of my cousins (and met her husband for the first time) in New Jersey.
